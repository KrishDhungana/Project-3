                <p>
                    I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. Which is a small country in south Asia. I was born there and lived there till the age of 5. After my parents won a greencard lottery, we moved to New York. This was a big change, as
                    Kathmandu and New York are very different. I attended preschool and kindergarden in New York. After living in New York for 3 years, we moved to Chicago. From one big city to another. I then began elementary school in
                    Chicago.

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>During my elementary school life, I was on the basketball and volleyball team. I was also on the math team and guitar club.</p>
                <p>
                    After elementary school I transitioned into high school. I went to Von Steuben, here in Chicago. Here is where I decided to stick with one sport(swimming) and where I began to learn code. I found my web development
                    and web design classes to be the most interesting, hence why I am an ITM/Cybersecurity major now. Through my knowledge of HTML, I began to make websites. It started with a current events webpage and it went as far as
                    creating the class webpage for my teacher.
                </p>
                <p> Below is one of the first websites I ever made:</p>

                <p>
                	Other than school, I held a number jobs. Such as working at Kohls and as a life guard. This was a great base for me, as it was my first taste of the real world. I understood what holding a job meant and the
                    responsibility that came with it.
                 </p>
                <p>Lastly, travel was a huge part of my life during this time. My family and I would travel at least once a year.</p>
                <p>Here is a list of all the places I have visited.</p>

                    <p>Now, I am a college student at Illinois Institute of Technology in, Chicago, IL. I am a ITM/Cybersecurity major, in my second year. I have already taken a number of coding and IT management classes.</p>
                    <p>
                        While college isn't in session, I work as a Tech Specialist at CDW. The Vernon Hills Location. My prior understanding of work and improved soft skills helped me land this summer job. I worked there this past summer,
                        taking apart hardware and installing software. It was a great experience into the IT industry.
